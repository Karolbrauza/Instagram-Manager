# Instagram-Manager

Right now manager is still in developing.

It using Selenium WebDriver and running like basic test code, but right now I'm searching to omit drag&drop protocol which is used to upload photos from local drive. I'm still looking for solution which don't use Auto GUI because it is to slow and not as much flexible as I want.
